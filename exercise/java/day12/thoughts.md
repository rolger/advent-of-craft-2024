# Thoughts of day 12

## first impressions
This time I tried following some of the hints, refactoring forth and back. I'm not satisfied with the result. There were too many long-lasting changes, 
a lot of manual steps and the code was broken for a long time. 

My new approach is to try to select the topics from Object Calisthenics step by step and apply them to the code.

## list of topics

* replace List<Child> childrenRepository with first class collection ChildRepository
* replace string with Behavior enum
* replace List<Toy> wishlist with first class collection ToyWishlist

## steps
