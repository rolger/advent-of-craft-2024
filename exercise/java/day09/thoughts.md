## first impressions
I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

## questions

Should I keep the other setters in the Builder? I decided to remove them, I don't need them currently.

Other alternatives:
* a separate builder for the class GiftRequest
* build() or createChild() method in the builder
* I'd like to name it like assertThat(aFeasibleGift().fromANiceChild()).isApproved();
